    "#### New York City is having lots of trouble. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Its mayor and the governor of New York state have been using their authority in clearly unfair ways--explicitly choosing to allow some New Yorkers to use their most basic rights--First Amendment rights--based mainly on the political preferences they share as hypocritical liberals, until a federal court ordered them to stop unfairly enforcing the most basic, important law in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recent riots in the city haven't been met with enough police action to prevent gross amounts of property damage and personal injury; the mayor wants to decrease funding for the city's police; and even before the recent riots, crime had increased in the city, following the state changing bail laws, which allowed arrested suspects a greater chance for pre-trial freedom.  \n",

    "#### A fair number of people with the means to have recently left or are considering leaving NYC, not to mention business owners and possibly their businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where might they go? Maybe another country? If they want to feel a minimal amount of culture shock, another big city? What about Canada--Toronto?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We'll compare the similarity of neighborhoods in NYC and Toronto to estimate the degree to which a frustrated potentially  mobile New Yorker might find the latter to their liking as a new home or business base."
